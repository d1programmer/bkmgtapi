# STEP ONE: DESCRIBE THE EXPECTED USER EXPERIENCE

The following is an expected user experience for the book management software, including the CLI Commands and their options.
The Command Line Interface will allow for users to be able to utilize create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations to manage a simple book management software.

The software will allow users to pass in command line prompts to update and modify the Book Management Software. Following the execution of a prompt, the API will respond with a status code and a description of what went right* [ or wrong (>.<) ]*
The API operations and details regarding them will be listed in the user-manual.txt file which is located in this repository. This manual will provide commands, optional flags, and examples of how to properly use them along with a response.

Users will be able to:
    -add a book to the system
    -list all books in the system
    -search for a specific book in the system
    -modify information about a book that is already in the system
    -create a collection
    -add a book to a collection
    -delete a collection
    -remove a book from a collection
