Thank you for continuing me to this round of the hiring process.
I hope that you all find my implementation of this API to be an adequate
representation of my skills and one that can be of you all's use on the
LXD Team at Canonical.


This user manual is meant to show the use cases in which I've implemented this
Book Management Software. 

With this, you should be able to 
    - Add books to the system
    - Delete books from the system
    - Create collections in the system
    - Add books to collections
    - Delete entire collections

I feel that these show the gist of what would be going on in the API. Other actions
are kind of a mix of the concepts being used in these. 

To run and test this software. 

You need to have Go installed on your device. You can download Go here:
[https://golang.org/dl/]

----------------------------------------------------

If having installed Go, and you still receive errors such as "command not found: Go"
after attempting to run, this may be of your help:

If you've downloaded and installed Go but are still getting the "command not found: go" error, it's possible that the Go binary directory is not included in your system's `PATH` environment variable. 

Here's what you can do to resolve this issue:

1. **Check Installation Directory:**
   Make sure you've installed Go in a directory that's included in your system's `PATH`. By default, Go is often installed in `/usr/local/go` on Unix-like systems (including macOS and Linux) or `C:\Go` on Windows. If you've installed Go in a different location, you'll need to adjust the steps accordingly.

2. **Update PATH Variable (Unix-like Systems):**
   If you're on a Unix-like system (macOS or Linux), you need to add the Go binary directory to your `PATH`. You can do this by modifying the `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc` file (depending on the shell you're using). Add the following line to the appropriate file:

   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   ```

   After adding the line, save the file and then run the following command in the terminal to apply the changes:

   ```sh
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   Replace `~/.bashrc` with the appropriate file name if you're using a different shell configuration file.

3. **Update PATH Variable (Windows):**
   If you're on Windows, you'll need to update the `PATH` environment variable to include the Go binary directory. Here's how:

   - Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables."
   - Click on "Edit the system environment variables."
   - In the System Properties window, click the "Environment Variables" button.
   - Under the "System variables" section, find the `Path` variable and click "Edit."
   - Click "New" and add the path to your Go binary directory (e.g., `C:\Go\bin`).
   - Click OK on each window to save the changes.

4. **Restart Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   After updating the `PATH` environment variable, close and reopen your terminal or command prompt for the changes to take effect.

Once you've updated the `PATH` environment variable, you should be able to run the `go` command without any issues. If you're still encountering problems, double-check that the installation path is correct and that you've saved and applied the changes to the environment variables.

----------------------------------------------------


Then you need to establish a mySQL connection on your
local device. 

You can download mySQL here [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/] if you have not already. 
It is important to replace the `connectionString` in connectDB() [in db.go] with your local username
and password for SQL.
Here [https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/java-components/advanced-management-console/2.27/install-guide/mysql-database-installation-and-configuration-advanced-management-console.html#GUID-12323233-07E3-45C2-B77A-F35B3BBA6592] 
is a link that will explain that in further detail.
(usually username is the user associated with your device i.e. the name that pops up on terminal
beside your command prompt, and password is the root password that you set when you first download mySQL)

Now that it is all set up. Simply run: `go run main.go db.go` and the system should start.

Open up a separate terminal window and input curl commands to make changes to the Book Management Software.

I provided a sample-curls.txt file for some of the curl requests you can put in to test this.

Once again, I hope this is a great representation of my skills, and I look forward to
hearing from you all!

Best,
