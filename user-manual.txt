Thank you for continuing me to this round of the hiring process.
I hope that you all find my implementation of this API to be an adequate
representation of my skills and one that can be of you all's use on the
LXD Team at Canonical.


This user manual is meant to show the use cases in which I've implemented this
Book Management Software. 

With this, you should be able to 
    - Add books to the system
    - Delete books from the system
    - Create collections in the system
    - Add books to collections
    - Delete entire collections

I feel that these show the gist of what would be going on in the API. Other actions
are kind of a mix of the concepts being used in these. 

To run and test this software. 

You need to have Go installed on your device. You can download Go here:
[https://golang.org/dl/]


Then you need to establish a mySQL connection on your
local device. 

You can download mySQL here [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/] if you have not already. 
It is important to replace the `connectionString` in connectDB() [in db.go] with your local username
and password for SQL.
Here [https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/java-components/advanced-management-console/2.27/install-guide/mysql-database-installation-and-configuration-advanced-management-console.html#GUID-12323233-07E3-45C2-B77A-F35B3BBA6592] 
is a link that will explain that in further detail.
(usually username is the user associated with your device i.e. the name that pops up on terminal
beside your command prompt, and password is the root password that you set when you first download mySQL)

Now that it is all set up. Simply run: `go run main.go db.go` and the system should start.

Open up a separate terminal window and input curl commands to make changes to the Book Management Software.

I provided a sample-curls.txt file for some of the curl requests you can put in to test this.

Once again, I hope this is a great representation of my skills, and I look forward to
hearing from you all!

Best,

Desmond T.
